# data_scientist_salaries_analysis

I'm currently finishing Google data Analytics courses from coursera. As a last ativity was proposed a case study  to perform an analysis about something my interest. 
Then I though Why not a analysis about data science salaries? Then it results in the analysis I have done below:

I could get data from kaagle, glassdoor and h1base, the last one was got through web scrapping though  code provided by  @yiuhyuk
from https://github.com/yiuhyuk/ds_salary_h1b/blob/master/h1b_salary.ipynb that I have adpted to get data through the 50 biggest cites OF USA.
Most data I could get was from USA, then this analysis is detailed for USA country. I could get a dataset about other contries, not so lage and detailed as dataset about USA country,
but we perform some analysis about data scientis salaries in others contries as well.

#Follow the question I have tried to ask:


###in 2021 at USA:


	How is it distributed range salaries per data science job role in 2021 at USA?  what about the average monthly salaries?

	What's the average salaries per USA location at 2021?

	Which companies pays more? The american one or non-american?

	Regarding public-private companies comparison, wich ones pays more and have better employeer's rating satisfaction ?

	in 2021, what is the distribution of average salary per companies in 2021 ( glassdoor+ h1dbase  can help)

	in 2021, what's the relationship of average salaries and compay size ?( glassdoor + h1base can help)


	what's the relationship between the employeer rating satisfaction and the average and companies revenue?


	what's the most required skills er job role in 2021 at USA ? 
	what's  the most required skills for data job roles in 2021 at USA ?

###contries in general:
	What's tbe data scientist salary  evolution during the period 2014 to 2022?

	What is the average salary distribution per contry in 2020-2021?

	In 2020-2021 period, what' the remote ration per job role distrubution?
		tip: Consider the 0,50,100 ratio categories associated with each job role, thus you gonna get only 3 graphs.
